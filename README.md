MathCanvas: AI-Powered Drawing Calculator

MathCanvas is an innovative AI-powered calculator that brings your drawings to life! Inspired by the iPad Math Notes/Calculator application, this project allows users to draw mathematical equations, which are then recognized and solved in real-time using the Gemini Flash AI API. Built with Python for the backend and React for the frontend, MathCanvas combines powerful AI with an interactive user interface to provide an intuitive and seamless experience for solving math problems.


#Key Features:

- AI-assisted drawing recognition
